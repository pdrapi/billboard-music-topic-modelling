### General Preparation for LDA

### LDA

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used to identify topics within the lyrics dataset.

### LDA with Tf-Idf

An advanced version of LDA incorporating Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (Tf-Idf) to enhance topic modeling results.

### Top2Vec

An exploration of the Top2Vec model for identifying topics within the dataset.

## Results
